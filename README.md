# Betweenness-centrality-and-Community-in-Graph
The app receives a file that includes all the edges of the graph with their weight and finds the betweenness centrality and the community.

A network has a “community” structure if the nodes can be grouped into sets which are densely
connected with ”many edges joining vertices of the same cluster and comparatively few edges
joining vertices of different clusters”.

The app is optimized so that it calculates quickly for a great number of nodes and edges.
